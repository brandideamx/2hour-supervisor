	<h2 class="header small">At What Point Is Behavior Considered Sexual Harassment?</h2>
	<p>Although federal law doesn't prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment and interferes with another individual's work. </p>
	<p>Some states have even broader standards for when a behavior is considered harassment.</p>
