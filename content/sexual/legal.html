	<p>Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates federal law (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and any applicable state and local law.</p>
	<p>Because the standards for sexual harassment may vary depending upon the state in which you work, it is important that you are familiar with the standards in your workplace and in those in which you manage employees.</p>

					Protections against sexual harassment are even broader under the New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"). In order to demonstrate sexual harassment under the NYCHRL, an employee only needs to prove that he or she was treated less well because of gender and that the treatment was more than a petty slight or trivial inconvenience.

					Given these broad legal standards, it is critical that all employees engage in appropriate conduct at all times in the workplace.
