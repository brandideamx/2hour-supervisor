        A transgender employee may join your organization having previously transitioned from their sex at birth to their new identity. You may also have employees who begin their process of transitioning at any point during their employment. It's important to understand what transitioning means.<br><br>
        <b>"Transitioning"</b> is a process some transgender people go through to begin living as the gender with which they identify, rather than the sex assigned to them at birth. This process may include social and/or physical transitioning described below.<br><br>
