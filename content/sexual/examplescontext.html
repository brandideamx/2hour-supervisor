		As you can see, there is a lot to consider while interacting with your employees and colleagues. The context, time, place and circumstances may affect whether your conduct towards another employee has crossed the line.  <br><br>

		<div class="accordion">
			<div class="accordion-head">For example:</div>
			<div class="accordion-body">
				<ul class="small">
					<li><span>Hugging a bereaved employee at a difficult moment may be acceptable, while asking an employee for a hug would not</span></li>
					<li><span>Offering an occasional compliment to someone on a new haircut or new outfit may be appropriate, while remarking about someone's appearance on a consistent basis would not</span></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		In all of your workplace interactions, it's important to remember that it's not your intent that
		matters; it's the impact on your colleagues and employees that you manage that determines the appropriateness of your conduct.
