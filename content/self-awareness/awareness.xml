    <![CDATA[Look at the two yellow lines. Are they the same length? Or is the top line longer than the bottom line?
			<br><br>
			The yellow lines are actually the same length.
			<br><br>
			What is going on here? Why does the top line appear longer?
			<br><br>
			The human mind judges the size of objects in the world based on its surroundings. In this case, our brain is tricked into interpreting the objects in this two-dimensional image as if it were a three-dimensional scene out in the world.
			<br><br>
			Because the yellow lines are drawn over converging lines, our brains process the top one as being further away, which tells us - incorrectly -- that the top line is longer.
			<br><br>
			This error reflects not a weakness but a strength of our amazing brains. Automatic mechanisms like this enable us to see and understand our three-dimensional world efficiently and accurately.
			<br><br>
			The human brain is hard-wired to make decisions rapidly, drawing upon our assumptions and experiences.  In primitive times, humans needed to make instantaneous judgments - about who and what was safe - as a matter of survival.  A quick determination of whether a person was a threat or harmless could be lifesaving.
			<br><br>
			This unconscious, hidden processing remains incredibly useful today.  We are constantly bombarded by massive amounts of information through all of our senses.
			<br><br>
			Our brains process 11 million bits of information per second, but we can only CONSCIOUSLY process 40 bits per second.  That means 99.999996% of the information our brain is processing is unconscious.
			<br><br>
			Our unconscious mind uses past experiences and exposure to constantly make lightning-fast generalizations about all that we encounter, automatically sorting people, places, and things into categories. These categories are incredibly useful most of the time, but they may cause us to overlook other equally important characteristics about the person.
			<br><br>
			This rapid sorting is what leads to people being stereotyped into convenient categories based on easily identifiable traits.
			<br><br>
			What buckets do you think others have placed you in?  Do you think you share all of the same characteristics of everyone else placed in your bucket? Your answer is probably, no.  Most people see themselves as unique and not the same as everyone who shares one obvious characteristic.
			<br><br>
			In addition to the more obvious "buckets" we put people into, we may also have stereotypes about much more subtle characteristics. For example, we hold stereotypes based upon someone's height, weight, foreign or regional accents or whether or not they are married or have children.
			<br><br>
			We all have positive and negative biases about different stereotypes and we may unintentionally treat individuals differently because of those biases.
			<br><br>
			These biases can affect:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Recruitment, hiring, and salaries</li>
				<li>Mentoring programs </li>
				<li>Employee interactions </li>
				<li>Team and project assignments</li>
				<li>Performance evaluations</li>
				<li>customer service, and</li>
				<li>Openness to new ideas </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			The good news is that by becoming aware of stereotypes and interrupting those biases, we can keep them from negatively impacting our workplace interactions and decisions. We can consciously choose to question the stereotypes that we hold and draw conclusions based on what we know, rather than what we assume. These conscious efforts will make us better managers, employees, co-workers and friends.
