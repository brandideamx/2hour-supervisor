00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.130
Take a look at these two lines.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.160
Which line is longer?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.260
Chances are, your mind is telling you that the bottom one is longer.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.090
But, what happens when the arrows are removed from the lines?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.210
Suddenly it becomes clear that both lines are the same length.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.130
We often refer to an image like this one as an optical illusion.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.170
It would be more accurately described as a cognitive illusion.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.000
Because the illusion is not created by our eyes, but by our brains.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.200
What do you see here?

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.100
You might see a young lady, or you might see an old woman.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.280
The way you look at something can affect how you see it.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.130
The fact is that there are both images in this drawing. Can you see them both?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.190
Without realizing it, we bring our own experiences, ideas and thoughts 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.070
with us when we try to make sense of the world around us.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.050
We all have stored knowledge about the world, and this affects what we see.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.090
Is this two silhouettes, or a vase?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.280
We each have our own lens through which we view the world.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.010
Rarely do we realize how subjective our perceptions are.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.190
If you had a pet rabbit growing up, you may see a rabbit in this image.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.030
If you live near a pond, you may see a duck.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.010
Both images are present.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.000
This is how bias can sneak into our lives, and into our interactions with others.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.230
These unconscious biases refer to the attitudes or stereotypes that,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.250
without our awareness or conscious control, shape our judgments 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.290
about people's abilities, potential and character.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.010
Our biases exist as a result of our experiences

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.090
socialization and our exposure to images and ideas.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.170
While the word bias has a negative connotation, our biases do not make us bad people,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.100
and the good news is that becoming more aware of our biases

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.100
can make us better managers, employees, co-workers and friends.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100
The next two modules will guide you through some exercises,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.150
to help you explore your own unconscious bias.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.150
You'll get some insights on how to manage your biases,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.150
and to think more deliberately about workplace decisions.
