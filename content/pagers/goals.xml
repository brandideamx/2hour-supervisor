		<body><![CDATA[As a supervisor, you are held to an even higher standard of behavior. As a person in a position of authority, you must exercise that authority with care.
		<br><br>
		You are also responsible for using your best efforts to prevent workplace harassment and discrimination. If you observe harassment you must report it.  If any harassment is reported to you, you must report that, too.  It's important that you are familiar with the circumstances and processes in which you are to report.  You could be held liable for failure to do so properly.
