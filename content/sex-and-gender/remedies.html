				<p style="font-size: 14px;">Employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about filing a charge of discrimination. A charge must be filed within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory action. After IDHR has completed its investigation and issued its determination, the employee may opt to proceed through the Illinois Human Rights Commission (IHRC) or by commencing a civil action in the appropriate circuit court.  Where the employing entity has an effective harassment policy in place and the complaining employee fails to take advantage of that policy and allow the employer an opportunity to address the problem, such an employee may, in certain cases, lose the right to further pursue the claim against the employer.</p><br>
