		Thanks for taking the time to do this exercise. It might have been a little uncomfortable, which is okay. Part of building self-awareness is understanding that all of us have what is called "unconscious bias" working behind the scenes.<br><br>
		We all have biases of one form or another due to our socialization, personal experiences, and values. Unconscious bias creeps into our everyday lives. Some common biases include:<br><br>

				<ul>
					<li><span>Obese people are lazy</span></li>
					<li><span>Tall men are stronger, more decisive leaders</span></li>
					<li><span>Disabled people require special attention</span></li>
				</ul>
			</div>

		<div class="accordion">
			<div class="accordion-head">Gender-based biases:</div>
			<div class="accordion-body">
